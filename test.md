# 1st Sweep: Before starting the engine
Looking towards the back of the left console, 
we start by setting the systems correctly, 
so they begin working from the moment that 
main generator power is received.
## ENGINE
1. On the EXT LIGHTING panel we set the MASTER
LIGHT switch to NORM, ANTI-COLLISION OFF,
POSITION to STEADY and WING/TAIL & FUSELAGE
switch to BRIGHT. Note that the WING/TAIL & FUSELAGE
switches move together as they share a common callback
in BMS. The FORM and AERIAL REFUELING knobs are
not implemented in the current version of BMS.
You won’t immediately see the lights come on as the jet
doesn’t have power yet. The lights will only come on when
the main generator comes online during engine start.

2. Moving up we quickly check the AUX COMM panel to
check that the CNI knob is turned to BACKUP. We move
one step further up and check that the MASTER FUEL
switch on the FUEL panel is positioned to MASTER and
that the guard is down. These should be correctly set at
ramp. The ENG FEED knob though needs to be rotated to
NORM to avoid fuel system malfunctions later on in the
flight if the fuel pumps are left switched off. 
The TANK INERTING switch is not implemented in BMS.

3. Battery power is enabled with the MAIN PWR switch to BATT on the ELEC
panel. The ELEC SYS caution light and the FLCS RLY, MAIN GEN and STBY
GEN lights (ELEC panel) should come on with battery power enabled. We need
to test the battery by moving down to the TEST panel and holding the FLCS
PWR TEST switch out of NORM to TEST. Please note when doing this with the
mouse you must keep the mouse button depressed on the hotspot to simulate
holding the switch or button in position. While doing that the FLCS PMG and the
ACFT BATT TO FLCS lights illuminate and the FLCS RLY light goes out (ELEC
panel). On the TEST panel the four FLCS PWR lights (ADBC) come on
indicating good power output to the FLCC. The MAIN GEN and STBY GEN
lights (ELEC panel) remain illuminated during the test.
You can now release the FLCS PWR TEST switch (release the mouse button). 
The lights reset to their initial
state. This check is eye candy and is not mandatory. 
Leave the MAIN PWR switch in BATT for now; we will
start the engines after we have finished the pre-start checks.
